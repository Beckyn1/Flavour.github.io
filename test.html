     <h3>Hawker Centers</h3>
    <p>Singapore is very famous for its Hawker Centers. Hawker centers are these food court-type places with a wide range of food. At the hawker centers, we made sure to try the famous michelin star hawker chan chicken and the michelin star hainanese chicken rice. Hawker centers are a great source of cheap and tasty food. The food definitely lived up to its expectations, as it was absolutely delicious, and I would definitely recommend going there and trying it if you ever go to Singapore.</p>

   <h3>Singapore Chilli Crab</h3>
    <p>We also tried the famous singapore chilli crab in Singapore. Singapore chilli crab is one of my all time favourite dishes. At the place we went to, they gave you a giant crab surrounded by delicious sauce. Chilli crab is super flavoursome, and I definitely recommend trying it with mantous (the chinese steamed buns). We went to a singapore chilli crab place called Jumbo Seafood, and although it was quite pricy, the food was amazing and in my opinion worth the price. </p>
